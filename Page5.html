<p class="Math"><b>Mathematicians seek and use patterns[8][9] to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or 
falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, 
mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of 
abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements.[10] Since 
the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic 
systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing 
truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at 
a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new 
scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued 
to the present day.</b></p>

<p class="Computer"><b>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out 
sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic 
sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. 
A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software)
, and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of 
computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. 
Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory 
devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like 
personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links 
hundreds of millions of other computers and users.</b></p>

<p class="Art"><b>In the perspective of the history of art,artistic works have existed for almost 
as long as humankind: from early pre-historic art to contemporary art; however, some theorists feel 
that the typical concept of "artistic works" fits less well outside modern Western societies.[11] One 
early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly 
translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived 
from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, 
there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.
20th-century bottle, Twa peoples, Rwanda, Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition 
to their decorative value.Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Kant, among others, questioned the 
meaning of art.[12] Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry 
is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine 
madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a–c), and yet in the Republic wants 
to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the 
disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad 
functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as 
divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly 
interpreted.[13]
With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, 
comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by 
medium, object, and manner.[14] For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, 
whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their 
object of imitation.</b></p>
